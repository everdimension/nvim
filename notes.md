# Notes

I'll use this file for notes and reminders
that don't make sense in the README or in the comments

## Diagnostics theming

These settings are used by the `neoclide/coc.nvim` plugin.
Since `./coc-settings` doesn't support comments, I'll leave
notes here

Possible diagnostic signs (`:CocConfig`):

```
{
	"diagnostic.errorSign": "•", // smaller
	"diagnostic.errorSign": "●", // larger
	"diagnostic.infoSign": "•"
}
```
